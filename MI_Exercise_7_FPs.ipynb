    "\n",
    "The more suitable method probably would be get_valences since it takes more material properties into account. Pt has a Pauling-EN of 2.28. Therefore a negative and positive oxidation state is possible depending on the properties of the other elements in the compound. For bonding partners with a high EN (e.g. F) a positive oxidation state is most likely. On the other hand for bonding partners with a lower EN (e.g. Na) a negative oxidation state is more likely. Therefore since both positive and negative oxidation states are possible, simply guessing the oxidation state should not give very reliable results."
